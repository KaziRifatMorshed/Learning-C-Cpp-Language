/*Lab test -3
Write a program that will take a string with spaces from the user as input.
Write four functions named "LTrim", "RTrim", and "MTrim", and "CountOccurrence".
Each of these functions will take a string as a parameter.

"LTrim" will delete all the spaces from the left hand side of the parameter
string and will return the string that will be obtained after deleting the left
side spaces.

"RTrim" will delete all the spaces from the right hand side of the parameter
string and will return the string that will be obtained after deleting the right
side spaces.

"MTrim" will keep only one space between every two consecutive words. There can
be multiple spaces between two words in a string. Only one space will be kept
and other spaces will be deleted.

"CountOccurrence" will recursively count the occurrences of "abc" in a parameter
string and will return the count. This function might also take other parameters
as you wish to accomplish the task.
